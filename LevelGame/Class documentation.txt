This is just a brief description of what the code is for.
for full documentation, look at LevelGameUML


Level Engine: this part of the code 
implements the levels. It tells the 
levels where things should generate.
the level engine is important to have 
the ability to create unique levels to 
pass to the game engine

Level 1:
a player has to battle ninjas while chasing after the golden snitch

Level 2: 
The player has to outsmart a firebreathing dragon to collect the trohpy to win



Tree: Tree is simply a drawable item.
 It cannot interact with the player and
  cannot move



Golden snitch: golden snitch is a type of 
coin. You have to catch it twice to move 
on to the next leveln it utilizes the random
 function to move sporatically away from the player.



Ninjas use a simple algorythm to move 
towards the player. They attack the player
 at range and can interact to hurt the player



Dragons do not move however they poses the
 ability to shoot fire at the player. This 
 range attack hurts the player while it is on it.
It uses a similar algorithm as the ninja to 
target the player



Fire is a item utilized by dragon that doesnt
 move but actually is created on the spot to 
 hit the player.



Trophys End the game. They are the final prize
 advancing past the final level. This doesnt 
 move as it is gaurded by a dragon.
